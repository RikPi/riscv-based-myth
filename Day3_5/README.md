# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

## Introduction
Welcome to the section where I illustrate the parts of TL-Verilog code developed during the labs. It was my absolute first time coding at such low level, before this I have never done any C, Assembly or hardware description language. 

It was a very tough course, but it was rewarding and well explained! I had a lot of fun and I feel like that I learned a lot.
